This repository contains a minimalist, high-end landing page scaffold for the temporary public-facing brand **RiskFortress** (part of MayaLok Corp). It is designed to convey an ultra-exclusive, confidential B2B service for physical-asset risk prediction.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main markup with Hero, Problem, Solution, Exclusivity sections.
- `styles.css` — dark, cinematic styles, responsive rules and subtle animations.
- `script.js` — small interactive bits: canvas background animation, hamburger menu, scroll reveal, footer year.
- `assets/` — placeholder for real media (not included).

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build step required.

Replace media

- Add a cinematic video or high-resolution satellite imagery in `assets/` and update `index.html` (the `#hero` canvas is intended to be a programmable animated background; swap for an actual video tag with `playsinline muted loop` if desired).

Design notes & next steps

- Replace placeholder SVGs and overlays with real data-driven visuals and approved topographical imagery.
- Integrate real invite-only contact routing (currently a `mailto:` to `inquiry@riskfortress.com`).
- For production: add CSP headers, inline critical CSS, and optimize assets.

This scaffold is provided without license restrictions for internal use and development. Do not publish the temporary branding without approval from MayaLok Corp.
